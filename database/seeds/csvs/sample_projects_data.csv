1,27-09-17 12:37,27-09-17 12:37,1,Wear performance analysis of shoulder prostheses,"As the third most common orthopaedic procedure in Britain, shoulder joint replacement is growing rapidly and the numbers of shoulder prostheses implanted increased dramatically as well. Wear is regarded as one of main contributors to the failure of shoulder implants. It is therefore important to measure the wear properties of the articulating surfaces within the joint. 
Investigation of wear characteristics through a comprehensive range of motion using a sophisticated shoulder simulator would reveal the durability of the material and the performance of component design. The preclinical test of wear would explain the components failures, find out a most appropriate component design, and minimise the risk of clinical complications. The principal tasks of the project are to screen the wear performance of novel Imperial design versus established commercial implants and determine the difference in wear performance of varying conditions.
The evaluation of the shoulder components is in vitro by using a bespoke shoulder simulator, which is capable of simulating physiological gleno-humeral forces and displacements during activities of daily lives. Appropriate wear testing protocol will be finalised to follow. The subsequent wear behavior of the components will be evaluated in macro and micro levels using gravimetric analysis (weight loss) & wear scar images and surface profile & roughness respectively.

The meniscus plays a critical role in load transmission, shock absorption, stability and in reducing contact stresses in the knee joint.  Meniscus injury is the most frequent orthopaedic intervention with an annual reported incidence of 60â€“70 per 100,000 persons. With limited natural and surgical repair capabilities, a meniscectomy (complete removal of the meniscus) is commonly performed. This presents a high risk of osteoarthritis development in the knee joint, leading to a total knee replacement in the long term. Orthonika is currently developing a synthetic total meniscus replacement to alleviate patient symptoms and prevent or delay the onset of osteoarthritis. 

 
Title: Does a total meniscus replacement provide chondroprotection?
The aim of this project is to provide insight on the chondroprotective effect of the developed meniscus replacement and how it compares to that of the natural meniscus in the ovine cadaveric joint. Positive and negative tests, meaning with the natural healthy meniscus and without the natural meniscus (simulating a meniscectomy) respectively, will provide a benchmark for the developed implant. In-vitro testing will be performed on a custom rig designed to simulate ovine gait, enabling evaluation of implant fixation, implant integrity, and chondroprotection following cyclic loading.

The plan is to design, make and test a new method using an artificial patch fixed to the bone within the head of the humerus. The prototypes will be made by additive manufacturing in a rapid prototyping machine. The shape of the surface will have to match the natural shoulder, obtained from medical scans. In addition to getting a surgeon to implant the patch into plastic replica bones, it may then move on to testing in a dead knee. Aspects such as designing the patch, the instruments required by the surgeon, and then measuring the accuracy of restoring the surface geometry of the shoulder will arise as the work progresses.",1,1,1,0,0,0

This can cause premature failure of components in service with potentially severe cost and safety implications. Fracture mechanics is a powerful technique for describing failure in materials and recently a fracture mechanics based environmental stress cracking test has been developed in which a constant load is applied to a single edge notch bend (SENB) test specimen and the resulting crack initiation and crack velocity is measured as a function of applied load conditions.  This test method will be applied to a range of polymers and the conditions required to induce ESC failure in some high performance polymers will be investigated.  ",1,0,1,1,0,0

7,25-09-18 11:54,25-09-18 11:54,2,An investigation into wood-polymer composites for industrial applications,"Modern industries produce large quantities of waste material which, in the longer term, is unsustainable.  Examples of waste material include various types of wood which are used in large quantities in the packaging industry.   There are significant efforts being made to find secondary uses for such materials and one proposed use is that the wood products be shredded or milled into fine particles, and that these then be used as a reinforcement for polymer composites.  This project will utilize various wood flours produced from a number of packaging product ranges as the reinforcement in a particulate reinforced polymer composite.  The samples have been supplied by the Hengdeli Group.  
The project follows on from a project last year in which wood particles and fibres were incorporated into the thermosetting polymer, epoxy.  The particle size distributions were studied and wood-polymer composite plates were manufactured and tested for tensile properties and fracture toughness.  The project will firstly perform some additional characterisation of these materials for thermal and water absorption properties, comparing values with neat epoxy.  Additional composites will be manufactured with (a) specific wood fibre lengths incorporated into an epoxy matrix and (b) wood fibres/particles incorporated into a thermoplastic matrix via injection moulding.  The moulding will use Hengdeli wood fibre/particle products and will take place at a commercial injection moulding  facility.   
Mechanical testing will investigate the tensile stress-strain behaviour, the compression properties and the fracture toughness.  The microstructure-property relationships will be investigated.  Interaction with technical consultants from the Hengdeli Group will be maintained throughout the project.

Experiments, especially for a large system, are usually expensive and time-consuming, whilst the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation provides a feasible alternative. The scale resolved CFD methods, such as DNS, LES or DES, are computationally prohibitive in the most of industrial applications. Therefore, the RANS remains as a favourable choice across the industries.
The suitability of the RANS modelling to an application is determined by the turbulence model, while the performance of the turbulence model is controlled by its constants. What constants should be used in the model for a complex flow system is a common question asked by the users. The advent of high-performance computing (HPC) has made computationally efficient, large-scale, CFD simulations routine in the most of the flow related analysis. The increased use of HPC has now enabled calibration to be performed on the CFD modelling.  In this project, you will carry out a Bayesian Calibration of the constants in a simple turbulence model, for example, the Spalart-Allmaras model or the standard k-Îµ model, in case of modelling the thermal mixing in a T-Junction. You will calibrate the 3-D RANS CFD simulations against a high fidelity LES simulation and provide the uncertainties related to the constants in the model. In this project, you will bridge the state-of-the-art turbulence modelling methods and the data science technology to achieve the accurate RANS simulation. In the meantime, you will establish/extend your knowledge of coding, CFD modelling, and the statistical analysis.

9,12-10-18 11:39,12-10-18 11:39,3,"Developing a new, ultra compact X-ray generator for high energy density physics experiments
","X-ray driven diagnostics are becoming the primary method of probing high energy density physics experiments, including those for extreme materials research and inertial fusion. However, producing high yield, short pulse doses of suitable X-rays is difficult. Synchrotrons and X-ray lasers offer one route but are large and somewhat expensive to run. Another option – a pulsed power driven X-pinch -  is cheap and can be made to be portable, opening up its use in labs around the world.
 
In an X-pinch 100s of KA of current are fed over 100s of ns through a pair of crossed metallic wires. The magnetic field at the cross over point is very high, leading the wire material here pinching and becoming extremely hot and dense, producing soft X-ray emission. As the pinch continues this region breaks and a micro diode is formed resulting in the production of even harder radiation.  The source size (few – 100microns), duration (ns) and yield (10s to 100s of mJ) are all perfect for techniques including radiography of implosions, X-ray diffraction and absorption spectrometry.
 
In the plasma physics group we have a small pulsed power engineering program to develop compact generators for X-pinch research. Over the last few years we have shrunk the required systems from lab sized to small table top. We are now looking to further improve this design with in built high voltage supplies, triggering and safety rather than having a support ‘cart’ that has to travel with the pinch. We are also looking to make the pinch significantly easier to use and more reliable.
 
Building on our previous work the MSc will involve design of the new generator, modelling of the circuitry, experience in pulsed power switching and testing, and blast/damage mitigation. The aim of the project will be to see the generator in use, radiographing compression experiments on our mega ampere MACH facility, and if time allows a new load – a high density gas puff – will be explored as a replacement for the wires, enabling operation with few second repetition, rather than the 30-60min reload time presently required.",1,1,1,0,0,0
10,27-09-17 15:24,27-09-17 15:24,4,Tribology of caramels: friction measurements in a simulated tongue-palate contact,"Food sensory attributes of creaminess and smoothness are related to friction experienced in the tongue-palate during mastication.   Caramel is a soft confectionary made of butter and sugar which is frequently used as a filling for chocolates.  During mastication the sweet is mechanically degraded in the mouth and the oral friction experienced by the consumer will contribute to the sensory experience of eating.  Currently food manufacturers rely heavily on human panel tests to develop new confectionary formulations which deliver the requisite sensory properties, preferably with reduced sugar and fat content.  However it would be beneficial to be able to replace panel tests with a simple bench test to screen new products for these sensory attributes of creaminess or smoothness.  The aim of the project therefore is to develop a simple bench-test to measure friction during mechanical degradation of soft sweets. 
 
Project tasks:
(a)	Review of existing research literature on tongue-palate tribology
(b)	Development of a ""caramel"" test protocol
(c)	Friction tests on existing lubrication test device for a range of conditions

This enables the inspection of tens of metres of pipe from a single transducer position and so is very attractive when the pipe is insulated or buried. In its original form the system was used for periodic inspection but with reduction in the cost of electronics and wireless communication, there has recently been a move to permanent installation. This opens the possibility of taking frequent readings and improving the detection sensitivity by looking for trends in the data, so making it possible to detect defects that are below the noise floor in a single reading. There are many possible techniques for trend detection and this project will explore different possibilities, testing the algorithms on both synthetic and real data. It will suit a student who is interested in data processing and computation.

It has previously been identified that humidity fluctuations are one of the main causes of fracture in paintings. This is a result of the differential strains that are induced within the painting as each layer shows a different dimensional response to the absorption of moisture. As paintings can be extremely valuable, it is rare that samples can be taken from the painting, therefore alternative methods to obtain representative samples must be explored. One problem with the use of representative samples is that the paintings may be hundreds of years old and it is not realistic to naturally replicate this aging process. This project will look at the effect of moisture on the painting constituents and the use of thermal aging to accelerate the drying process of oil paints.

To this end, considerable efforts are being made to introduce lightweight materials to vehicle structures. The highest weight saving can be achieved using composite components, and the most widely used composite materials are polymer matrix composites (PMCs). To unlock the potential of PMCs in the aerospace and automotive industrial sectors, an innovative, low-cost, hot stamp forming technology is under development for producing PMCs components. To ensure the success of the new forming process, it is critical to understand the effects of forming conditions on the materials deformation behaviours.

In last two decades, the adoption of piezoelectric elements, has received considerable attention by many researcher for its potential applicability to different areas of mechanical, aerospace, aeronautical and civil engineering. Recently, a number of studies of blades vibration control via piezoelectric plates and patches have been reported [4-6]. These could be very interesting with reference to the problems mentioned above, indeed this type of materials are very efficient for active control of vibrations. 
This is teh last of a series of MSc and 4M projects carried out by students in previous cohorts and has teh support of researchers in the Vibration and Dynamics and Tribology groups.  In their previous work [7], the project supervisors and their collaborators studied a model to control the blade vibrations by piezoelectric elements.  An optimal placement method of piezoelectric plates has been developed and applied to different loading scenarios for realistic configurations encountered in gas turbine blades. It has been demonstrated that the optimal placement depends on the spectrum of the load, so that segmented piezoelectric patches have been considered and, for different loads, an optimal combination of sequential and/or parallel actuation and control of the segments has been studied.
An apparatus has also been set up to carry out an experimental investigation. The proposed project aims at improving and optimisig the design of the rotating blades' rig and its control system.  A series of tests will then be carried out to corroborate existing models (e.g. [7]) and probe the potentials of the developed control technique.

At present the only treatment for end-stage OA is replacing the joint with an artificial hip or knee which is an expensive and often traumatic experience.  OA is often attributed to mechanical damage of the articular cartilage occurring loading and movement of the joint.  Articular cartilage is lubricated by Synovial fluid which helps to support the load and reduce friction, and hence wear, at the joint surfaces.  The chemical composition of human SF varies significantly and this is thought to affect the onset of OA.  We are currently working with Dr Matt Jaggard of the Musculoskeletal Group analysing the metabolic properties of human SF samples collected at their clinic.  One important aspect is the protein profile in SF and we have been running Fourier transform Infrared spectra to analyse the chemical composition of these fluids.  Although we see differences in the spectra the very many overlapping peaks makes interpretation difficult; this is where your data analysis skills are required, and what makes this an interesting multi-disciplinary project, where the ability to handle and interpret data is key to our understanding. You will be exposed to cutting-edge biotribology research and develop important skills in data handling, which can be transferred to a number of different fields.
The project involves analysing FTIR spectral data of human and model SF. The spectra will be run by a PhD researcher on the project and no chemical knowledge is required.  The focus of this project is developing fast and reliable automated data analysis methods to separate the overlapping peaks and aid interpretation. The project will benefit from the availability of advanced tools used to analyse large datasets in other areas of engineering (X-ray and neutron diffraction) and finance.
Project tasks:
(a)          Review of existing research literature on SF and data analysis methods
(b)          Development of a deconvolution/peak fitting protocol using model SF
(c)           Mapping of protein content in human SF

37,02-10-18 9:36,02-10-18 9:36,14,Design Parameter Study on Performance of Steam Generators,"Steam generators (SGs) in pressurised water reactors (PWRs) are one of the key components, where the steam is produced to drive a turbine to generate electricity. Inside the SGs, the heat produced in the reactor core is transferred to the secondary side. Designing an SG can be subject to many requirements and constraints to ensure the prevention of any core damage and the efficient operation of an electricity generating system. For instance, the primary coolant arriving at the SGs have flow rates, pressure, and temperature which are determined by the reactor design. The SG must also be able to produce steam at the flow rate and pressure which are required by the steam system consisting of the turbine.
There are several parameters which may affect the performance of the SG, including tube bundle and circulation. Inside the SGs, there exists a tube bundle which can affect a pressure drop in the SG, a geometry of the SG, and a rate of heat transfer from the primary side to the secondary. Many of SGs in PWRs are recirculating SGs. As the flow in the secondary side enters the steam-water separator, the steam exits through the top of the separator, while water recirculates to an annular gap in the secondary shell. The amount of recirculation is described by the circulation ratio.

This project aims to investigate the effect of these parameters on the performance of a steam generator in PWRs using a systems code (i.e. RELAP5-3D), which is an analysis tool to simulate the thermal-hydraulic behaviour of a nuclear reactor. By optimising these parameters, the optimum (or near-optimum) design may be produced, taking the design requirements and constraints into account. Additionally, a transient behaviour of the SG due to e.g. different loadings, the formation of deposit, etc. is to be simulated to determine its effect on the performance of the SG.

This project aims to build a finite element (FE) model of the bone at the nanoscale. 

Bone mineral density (BMD) is a standard clinical measurement used to identify people who are likely to suffer a fracture. BMD is used for this purpose because BMD is related to the strength and thus fracture of the bone. However, the relationship between BMD and bone strength is poorly understood and this lack of understanding leads to significant difficulties identifying patients likely to suffer fractures. Having established the FE model this project will aim to investigate how increasing BMD (essentially more and/or larger crystal nanostructures in the model) is related to increased bone strength and hence increase the ability to identify patients at risk of fracture.

Prerequisite: you need to either already have some experience with finite elements or to take the FEAA course this year.

The chamber allows the observation of the change of the phase of a liquid while the chamber pressure is reduced in a controlled way and the liquid temperature is maintained constant. Imaging of the liquid and bubble (vapour) formation as a function of time and the environment temperature and pressure will be performed using high speed imaging. The considered parameters will be the chamber gas pressure and liquid temperature under steady and transient conditions and the rate of change of the pressure. The final outcome is the understanding of the temporal evolution of the liquids under flash boiling conditions.

45,05-10-18 13:02,05-10-18 13:02,17,Composite 3D Printer,"3D printing is a computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing process that involves stacking layers of molten material upon a heated bed. 3D printed parts are typically susceptible to fracture failure due to poor interlaminar adhesion.

3D printers capable of printing in composite material exist in the marketplace. One such printer is the Markforged Mark Two, which is capable of printing in an Onyx matrix reinforced with materials such as â€˜Carbon Fiber, Fiberglass and Kevlarâ€™ . The Markforged Mark Two achieves composite 3D printing using a dual extrusion system, consisting of one extruder and hot end each for the matrix and reinforcement. Composite 3D printing can also be achieved by mixing chopped strands of reinforcement fibre with molten polymer prior to extrusion. This results in the chopped fibre strands being aligned with the extrusion direction. Both extrusion methods of printing allow the fibre orientation in a part to be changed by varying the printing process, whilst the latter method only requires one extruder and one hot end.

The tensile and fracture performance of 3D printed materials can be observed using tensile testing and double cantilever beam (DCB) testing respectively. Manufacturing suitable samples for these testing processes can be achieved by designing the samples in computer aided design (CAD) software capable of generating computer aided manufacture (CAM) g-code software, such as Autodesk Fusion 360.

Aim
Investigate the effect of extrusion methods and fibre orientation on fracture toughness of 3D printed composite materials.

Objectives
â€¢	Design samples with varying extrusion directions for tensile testing and DCB testing in Fusion 360 
â€¢	Print samples on a Markforged Mark Two printer in a suitable composite
â€¢	Test Markforged samples and identify causes of tensile and fracture failure
â€¢	Procure and adapt an existing rheometer to extrude molten polymer material
â€¢	Design and manufacture a three axis CNC bed platform and combine with the polymer extruder to make a custom composite 3D printer
â€¢	Print and test samples again on the custom printer
â€¢	Compare samples printed on the custom printer to the Markforged samples and identify causes of tensile and fracture failure
â€¢	Iterate material, printing and extrusion parameters to improve the fracture performance of the samples

This is all controlled by slice files, where a 3D part is split into horizontal slices, usually about 40 microns thick. The slice file gives the laser the x,y,power,exposure data to melt all the powder on that slice. We are very keen on building lattice structures with AM, and that requires a unique slice file, where the laser only fires dots onto the powder bed to create thin lattice struts. If a lattice strut is perpindicular to the build direction, it has a circle cross section. If it is at an angle to the build direction, it won't have a circular cross section, rather will have an elliptical cross section. This final year project will write code that will translate a wireframe lattice (created in Rhino) to a Renishaw MTT slice file format that is read by the AM machine. The code will therefore create the correct diameter circles/ellipses for the laser to trace, to manufacture the desired lattice structure, with whatever strut diameter we desire. You need to be decent at coding for this proejct, and an interest in additive manufacture would be good too.

It has yet to be introduced in aerospace due to  the potential formation of central cracks (the cavity formed in the central region of the CWR product). Due to the complex stress states on the central region of the workpiece, the fracture mechanism has not to be well understood. A reliable fracture criterion for the prediction of central crack is also lacking. 

This project aims at developing a proper fracture criterion which can well predict the central cracks, based on the understanding of fracture mechanisms in CWR. The objectives include: (1) understand the stress and strain states on the workpiece in CWR via FE simulation; 
(2) understand the roles and interaction of normal stress and shear stress on fracture mechanism via biaxial tests;
(3) Propose a fracture criterion based on the fracture mechanism, and verify this criterion by comparing the simulated results with experimental ones in literature;

Owing to the influence of several competing factors, the fundamental mechanisms of RCF are not well understood. In particular, material microstructure is known to have an influence on the initiation and propagation of RCF cracks but the exact mechanisms of this are poorly understood. In an attempt to shed some light on this, this project will use an existing triple-disc contact fatigue rig available in the Tribology Group to study the initiation and propagation of such cracks with different materials and contact conditions. Usually such studies are performed with hard steels. However, these have a complex microstructure consisting of tempered martensite, retained austenite, carbides, inclusions etc. This complexity makes it difficult to track the relationship between microstructure and RCF cracks. To overcome this problem, this project will use specimens made of simpler materials, and bronzes in particular. Once RCF cracks have been generated and grown under controlled conditions in these specimens, they will be sectioned, polished, and etched, and then inspected using optical and SEM microscopy, as well as other techniques, such as TEM and XRD, if required. The observations should provide new insight into the influence of microstructure on RCF damage initiation and progression. 

The project is of true research nature. It will run in parallel with other research in the same field that is currently on-going in the Tribology lab, and will therefore benefit from interaction and support from PhD students and Post-Doctoral researchers.

Humans are able to feel how much normal force to exert on the object, no matter what material the object is made of (soft or hard), in order to pick up that object safely - essentially we can feel the friction force between the object and our fingers! The challenge is to make robots that can mimic this feel which is essentially a tribological problem. 

Hence, this project will explore the application of Tribology robotic grip. The idea is to use some existing contact mechanics models to predict contact pressures between the robot 'fingers' and the object being picked up, in combination with tribological test rigs in the Tribology Group, and ultimately to attempt to combine these tribological predictions with appropriate sensor outputs which can tell the robot whether to exert more force to improve the grip.

61,27-09-18 12:33,27-09-18 12:33,21,Development of Condition Monitoring Techniques for Detection of Incipient Damage in Machine Elements,"Efficient and reliable operation of many machine elements, including rolling bearings, gears and cam-follower systems, largely relies on the performance of non-conformal, rolling-sliding lubricated contacts, such as those between two meshing gear teeth or rolling element and a bearing raceway. These contacts operate under very high stresses, with contact pressures in the range of 1-4 GPa, which are cyclic in nature owing to the kinematics of the contact. To reduce friction and damage to the contacting surfaces, a very thin (~100s of nm) elasto-hydrodynamic lubricant film exists between them. This is commonly less than the height of surface asperities on the contacting bodies so that substantial metal-to-metal contact occurs. Such harsh operating conditions can lead to various forms of surface damage, including rolling contact fatigue (development and growth of surface or subsurface cracks and eventual detachment of a segment of material; this can manifest itself as either pitting (damage on macro contact level) or micropitting (damage on asperity contact level)), scuffing (excessive adhesion and localised welding of the surfaces), and adhesive or abrasive wear. Early detection of such damage can contribute enormously to the reduction in maintenance costs of a wide range of mechanical systems, reduced down-time and prevention of unexpected failures which can be costly or worse, safety critical, such as in the case of helicopter gearboxes for example. However, due to the very small scale of such damage (100s of microns) and other complicating factors (presence of lubricant, random stress history due to roughness etc.) successful detection of such damage at an early stage is rather difficult to achieve. This project will explore use of a selection of machine condition monitoring techniques for detection of such damage. First, the applicability of a recently developed magnetic-flux leakage (MFL) sensor to detection of damage in real rolling bearings will be assessed. To provide a comparative assessment, simple vibration signals will be recorded on the same set-up. This will necessitate building a very simple experimental set-up which will incorporate the MFL sensor into an operating rolling bearing. If progress allows, other condition monitoring techniques will also be explored in the same set-up. 
The project is linked to a number of PhD and post-doc research projects in the Tribology Group, as well as being of interest to some of our industrial partners, and the selected student will therefore have significant resources at their disposal. ",1,1,1,1,0,0

As part of the competition, the rover must be capable of traversing 30 metres of an unknown surface of sand and randomly distributed rocks within 10 minutes. The vertical height of the rocks varies from 5 to 40 cm; thus, the suspension of the Rover must allow obstacles of varying heights to be climbed.
This FYP will encompass analysis focussing on the tribological aspect of the wheel groove geometry to optimise traction in sandy and rocky terrain. Additionally, the stresses, dynamics and vibrational characteristics of the rover suspension will be investigated to ensure competition requirements are fulfilled. Possible approaches include incorporating a three-bevel gear counter-directional differential and a novel 'rocker-bogie' system. Experimentation to quantify results will be conducted before competition entry.

Aim: Implement a powertrain and suspension system for a rover for entry into the UK Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (UKSEDS) Lunar Rover Competition

Objectives:
- Investigate and maximise the traction provided by the wheel design. The wheels feature grooves, of which the depth and geometry could be optimised for sandy environments.
- Implement a counter-directional differential to allow greater stability over rocky terrain. This could potentially include the use of a servomotor to drive a bevel gear within the differential, allowing the rover legs to be actively controlled.
- Explore the prospect expanding the suspension to a six-wheeled 'Rocker-bogie' mechanism, which could further enhance the rover's climbing ability.",1,0,1,1,0,0

79,26-09-18 8:28,26-09-18 8:28,24,Carbon fibre material properties,"Aircraft manufacture increasingly uses carbon fibre composite materials because of their light weight and high structural performance. Multiple layers with fibres in controlled patterns of different directions can make up a very strong sheet material, used for example for wing skin and panel components.  Non Destructive Testing (NDT) of these materials to detect damage can use ultrasonic waves that travel along the sheet. The development of the NDT requires knowledge of the wave speeds in the sheet, which depend on the alignment of the fibres. The NDT group has a software modelling program that can predict the speeds, using stiffness information about the sheet. Last year a 4th year project student developed a Matlab program to calculate that stiffness information.  The aim of this year's project will be to enhance the technical basis of the calculation in the program, to further develop the program for general use, and to perform calculation studies to assess the range of validity of its use. So the work will consist of Matlab programming, theoretical calculations of stiffnesses (solid mechanics/stress analysis theory), and investigations of results found using the program. If successful, the outcome of this project has the potential to be reported in a journal paper. This project would particularly suit a student who is interested in considering a career in research.

Advancements in electronics mean they can now include a great deal of components within

on Earth the heat can leave the satellite through convection, this is unavailable in space and
so the satellite must rely on conduction and radiation alone to remain at a correct working

on half power for a period of time, which is quite frustrating to their customers.

â€¢	Perform a literature review to investigate the most efficient methods for improving air quality at the roadside and the role that different types of plants would play within the methods identified above.
â€¢	From the literature review, identify several plants that reduce levels of air particulates and conduct further research to determine their suitability to be grown in an urban setting.
â€¢	Identify the busiest roads within a given city (such as London) and determine the maximum permissible width of a vegetation barrier for these roads.
â€¢	Design a vegetation-based solution to improve roadside air quality of an urban road. 
The first objective would be to investigate, by means of a literature review, the most efficient methods for improving air quality at the roadside and the role that different types of plants would play within these methods. This would set the groundwork for the majority of the FYP because a lot of air pollution is caused by road traffic, which could be partially negated using roadside vegetation. This would not be restricted to urban roads because the main use of vegetation barriers in cities is to reduce traffic noise rather than air pollution. The main plant categories to look at would be trees, shrubs and creepers/climbing plants.
Using the information gathered from the literature review, several plants could be identified, within each of the three categories, that have been proven to reduce levels of air particulates, as this is the main type of air pollution that plants can have a significant effect on. The second objective would be to conduct further research on each of these plants to determine their suitability to be grown in an urban setting and produce a data set of all the required characteristics. These would include: dimensions; pollution and stress resistance; sensitivity to sunlight, humidity, temperature and water availability; type of leaf surface; and depth of root system (not an exhaustive list). Each characteristic would have a numerical value of importance, which would then allow the plants to be ranked from most to least suitable for each of the plant categories.
The third objective would be to identify the busiest roads within a given city (London is the most obvious choice) and determine the maximum permissible width of a vegetation barrier for these roads. The busiest roads could be identified by searching for information provided by traffic/road regulators. The latter could be done by searching for online records of the road building plans, taking images from Google Street View or other online records that provide details of the general road layout, such as streetlight placement, width of pavement, locations of obstructions etc. This information is necessary for being able to conduct the fourth objective and could eventually lead to a design that could be implemented on a city-wide basis.
The fourth objective would be to design a vegetation-based solution to improve roadside air quality of an urban road, roughly 1-mile long. There is still a lot of scope for this design, as the solution might be non-intrusive (i.e. placed on the pavement) or intrusive, where the structure of the pavement might have to be altered. If this stage is a success, a prototype could be produced to test whether the solution is viable or not. The size of the prototype depends on the budget, so to stay below Â£250, it would be approximately 5 metres long and 1 metre wide. To test the suitability, a sample of air from a busy road would be collected and released along one side of a large containment vessel, with measurements of the air particulate concentration being taken at set distances with and without the prototype in place. If such a vessel is not readily available, a similar experiment could be performed next to a busy road.

However usefult these efforts, bottles and bags are not nano-particles. A main source of nano-particles is the daily washing of clothes: fabrics wear substantially during a laundry cycle, an average piece of clothing sheds almost 1 g of mass every time it is washed. These particles are too small to be filtered and end up in the ocean.

Improved knowledge is the first step towards developing more wear resistant fabrics and this final year project focuses on developing a better understanding: The way in which these fibres fracture and wear away is unclear, and a lot of the key parameters are unknown.  The focus of this project is on exploratory research and therefore it is not fully defined. An experimental approach seems appropriate, but a computational approach would also be interesting - or a combination, depending on the student's preferences.
 
Tasks include:
- Literature review of current standards and fabric wear mechanisms
- Development of (1) an experimental setup and protocol for testing OR (2) a computational model (
- Conduct a computational parameter study or an experimental programme of research 
- Conclude on grease performance under different loading and environment conditions

To prevent this from happening, the application of a sunscreen to the skin is recommended. For these to remain effective, the sunscreen needs to be reapplied every few hours, as the cream is removed from the skin. This is particularly important around the 'edges' of clothing, where collars and cuffs progressively rub away the sunscreen. Current best-practice in industry for testing the durability of a sunscreen is asking a number of people to apply sunscreen and perform activities, such as walking for a certain duration, after which the efficacy of the remaining sunscreen is tested using a UV light. This protocol is expensive, cumbersome and prone to large variations and even errors. The aim of this project would be to develop a new laboratory based test-protocol for evaluating the durability of sunscreens.
Project tasks include:
(a) Review of current practice in industry and existing scientific literature 
(b) Investigating methods of characterising the amount of remaining sunscreen
(c) Development of a test protocol, including materials and test conditions
(d) Comparing the efficacy of a range of commercially available sunscreens

Demand is rising for this type of implant due to an ageing population and higher expectations of the quality of life. The most common type of artificial hip uses a metal (CoCr alloy) femoral head loaded and articulating against a polymer (UHMWPE) acetabular cup. As the polymer is a much softer material, wear will inevitably occur at the rubbing surface and this will eventually result in the failure and revision of the implant.  At present we understand little about the early stages of surface damage and how this is related to changes at the polymer molecular level.  The project will be to develop a method whereby early stage damage is identified through the development of a Raman spectroscopy method.
A small-scale test device will be used to reproduce the metal-polymer rubbing contact and an advanced Raman spectroscopy technique used to quantify damage. The project is experimental and full training will be given in these techniques.
Project tasks:
(a)	Review of existing research literature on UHMWPE wear mechanisms tribology
(b)	Development of a sliding wear test protocol

The main novel component of the engine is the pre-cooler, in which the incoming hot air is cooled before the compression stages. The energy extracted from the air in this way is used by a close-circuit Helium loop to power the turbomachinery of the engine. However, during take-off and at low speeds an extra heat source is required to supply this energy: this is the role of the pre-burner, which provides this extra heat to the Helium loop through a heat exchanger. The objective of this project is to study the thermoacoustic stability of the pre-burner and heat exchanger configuration.
 
Thermoacoustic instabilities occur in combustion chambers of both gas turbines and rocket engines. They are caused by a positive feedback loop between the unsteady heat release of the combustion process and the natural resonant frequency of the combustion chamber. Typically, acoustic waves generated by the flame are reflected at the boundaries of the combustion chamber back to the flame zone, where they perturb the flame and generate further heat release fluctuations. These in turn induce further acoustic waves which can turn into an instability when positive feedback occurs. Two main factors determine if an acoustic mode is stable or unstable in a combustion chamber: firstly, the coupling of the acoustic waves and the unsteady heat release, and secondly the acoustic energy dissipated or lost through the combustion chamber boundaries.
 
Both gas turbine and rocket combustion chambers present a choked outlet, where the acoustic impedance can be obtained using simple mathematical models. The pre-burner of the SABRE engine ends instead with a heat exchanger, which imposes a different acoustic impedance. This in turn changes the thermoacoustic instability analysis of the combustion chamber in two main aspects: firstly, the acoustic modes and frequencies change due to the different outlet impedance, and secondly, the acoustic losses due to acoustic vortex shedding on the tubes becomes significant, leading to a loss in acoustic energy that tends to stabilize the mode. The understanding of this boundary condition is crucial to determining the stability map of the pre-burner.
 
This project aims to model the acoustic impedance of a bundle of heat exchanger tubes, and its effect on the stability of the pre-burner. The project will start by modelling the boundary condition induced by a bundle of heat exchanger tubes mathematically. The effect of such boundary on the stability of a simple pre-burner will be then analysed using OSCILOS, the low order modelling tool for thermoacoustic instabilities. Time permitting, the boundary models could be then tested using canonical CFD simulations in 2D or 3D configurations.

The cellsâ€™ performances and lifetimes are highly dependent on operational temperatures. As a consequence, battery thermal management is a key challenge facing the automotive industry.

Detailed understanding of a cellâ€™s heat generation rates and heat dissipation channels is essential of thermal management system design. In experimental testing, cells are charged or discharged according to a predetermined procedure, and various parameters, including the thermal response, are monitored. It is evident that certain cell geometries are beneficial for the dissipation of heat energy to surroundings. However, a quantified relationship between cell geometry and heat dissipation capabilities has not yet been established. This is because of the complexity of a cellâ€™s thermal behaviour. Heat generation and heat dissipation rates are dependent on the cellâ€™s state of charge, internal temperature and cooling mechanism.

A vortex ring can travel, invisibly, over significant distances toward a target. When it arrives, the vortex ring will disrupt the flow around the drone.

A research project is proposed to address the following questions:

(1) Vortex ring generation: how big, how far, how fast, how stable, how strong (in the wind), and how much input energy is required? Further, what is the best way in practice to generate the ring?
(2) Drone disruption: what effects do vortex rings have on drones?
(3) Strategy: what's the optimum approach? How many cannons? How many rings? Ground based or air based?  

This project requires an experimentalist to build a vortex generator and invent ways of measuring its performance such as flow visualisation and velocity/pressure measurements. The effects on a drone could also be tested, e.g. in the drone arena.

Schlumberger has developed a model-based system for designing the start-up of oil wells that rely on electric submersible pumps (ESPs). This project is about the development of numerical models that can be tuned to field data and then used predictively for planning and control.
 
An oil well produced with an ESP often shuts down and is required to re-start. Every re-start is dangerous as the transients can cause damage to the reservoir (which is a valuable asset), and to the pump (which is very costly to replace). A mathematical model of the system to be used in designing a start-up must account for these transients, including in the reservoir.
 
Reservoirs are complex; data about these underground systems is typically very limited and therefore purely predictive modelling of the transients is challenging. However, by using field data from the producing reservoir, we can in principle select and tune an appropriate model to provide effective predictions.
 
This project is about the implementation, selection, and tuning of an appropriate mathematical model. These models are typically partial-differential equations (PDEs) with spatial and temporal variation; an approximate solution of these equations can be found numerically, for example using measured data to inform the boundary and initial conditions.
 
Measured data from oil wells during start-up will be provided for the project, along with a simple pre-existing reservoir model as a Matlab code.

116,27-09-18 12:21,27-09-18 12:21,37,A New Type of Lubricant Additive,"Lubricant additives are chemicals that are blended with base oils to perform specific tasks.  Conventional friction modifier additives are molecules which form films on components to reduce friction when surfaces come into contact.  This type of additive should have no effect under full film conditions when the surfaces are separated by a continuous layer of oil.  However, a previous project at Imperial College discovered an additive that was able to reduce friction even when surfaces were fully separated.  The additive is believed to promote an elusive phenomenon, known as liquid slip, whereby the lubricant slides against component surfaces in the manner of a solid.

The aim of this project is to carry out a programme of experiments and analysis to 1) ascertain whether liquid slip is in fact the mechanism responsible for this friction reduction, 2) assess whether this additive can be incorporated into a commercial engine oil.  This will be achieved using a Mini Traction Machine (MTM) [2] to measure friction and an Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL) test rig [2] to measure film thickness.

The aim is to a develop an acoustic emission sensing technique to monitor automotive rubbing contacts in order to assess lubrication performance.

It is important to be able to monitor friction and wear behaviour in automotive contacts, since these parameters determine engine efficiency and durability.  However, this is often not possible using standard measurement techniques due to the inaccessibility of sliding contacts in engines.  One means of addressing this challenge is to monitor the transient elastic waves that are emitted from a contacting interface as a result of friction-induced deformation and micro-fracture events.

In this project, an automotive piston-liner pairing will be simulated using existing friction test equipment, while acoustic waves generated in the contact will be monitored using piezoelectric sensors and a data acquisition system.  Contact parameters, such as surface roughness contact pressure, will be controlled and signal processing techniques applied to help correlate emission signals to the friction and wear mechanisms occurring.

Approximately 3% of the fuel energy of an IC engine is lost to piston/cylinder friction (this amounts to a cost of around 3.8 pence per litre of fuel).  Automotive manufacturers are currently exploring ways of reducing these losses, since increasingly stringent emission regulations require highly efficient vehicles.  A possible solution is to improve lubrication performance by applying laser surface texturing to the cylinder liner (i.e. create pockets on its surface) [1].  Unfortunately, there is considerable disagreement and confusion in the scientific community regarding the effectiveness of this approach.  However, recent tests at Imperial College, using custom-build equipment, have shown conclusively that piston friction can be reduced by up to 60%, provided the surface texture on the liner component has a specific geometry [2].  

The aim of this project is to perform experiments that will help understand the mechanisms by which surface texture can reduce friction.  To do this, components will be textured using laser etching and a range of test apparatus will be used to measure friction and film thickness.  This approach will differ from many of the tests reported in the literature, in that the lubrication conditions will be accurately controlled.  Specifically, the in-contact surface deformation and lubricant viscosity will be selected prior to testing.  The research will be carried out using a custom built friction test rig and commercial CETR UMT2 tribometer [3].  Addition a support will be provided by experts from Volvo.

The aim of this project is to determine the key requirements of functionality and initial data required for the development of a WUI fire spread and evacuation modelling tool. This would be a tool that satisfies the current modelling gaps outlined in this area, with the aim of developing a model that can be tested against previous WUI site case studies.

","Composite materials such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) are used extensively in industry for aerospace, transport and many other engineering applications. The single-phase epoxy however, due to their high polymer crosslink density, are in general relatively brittle materials and are frequently toughened by the addition of a rubbery phase in the epoxy matrix. Different methods of toughening have been achieved through the insertion of different rubbery materials.
Moreover, to meet demanding safety requirements especially in aerospace applications, these composite materials shall be in accordance to high fire safety requirements and standards. It has been observed that improvements in toughness might come at the expense of flammability, and vice versa. Hence the need to investigate improvement of both properties at the same time.
Research has been conducted which has ascertained the amelioration in mechanical toughness by the addition of core shell rubber to the epoxy matrix. On the other hand, the addition of nano-silica particles has also been shown to improve materialâ€™s strength and flame-retardant simultaneously. However, very little study has been conducted on the behaviour of these epoxies in composite structures so far. These mechanical properties and fire-retardant properties are therefore to be obtained via multiple tests conducted on carbon fibre reinforced polymers laminates using different composition of the modified epoxies.

The aim of this project is to investigate the simultaneous improvement toughening and fire resistance of carbo fibre reinforced polymers modified with silica and core shell rubber (CSR) nano-particles. While the latter have been found to considerably improve the toughness of epoxies, the former has been found to increase fire-retardant and structural strength. 
The plan of the thesis is to manufacture and test carbon fibre reinforced polymers infused with epoxies with different weight percentage (wt.%) of both nano-modifiers, as well as hybrid compounds, to assess the mechanical and chemical properties of the materials. An analysis of combustion products could also be performed.

The population balance equation (PBE) is a rigorous method for modelling the evolution of the particle size distribution. When aerosol dynamics occur in a turbulent flow, there are fluctuations in all variables that result in unclosed terms in the PBE. In soot formation, in particular, there are correlations arising from the non-linear kinetics of nucleation and growth that depend on the gas-phase species and number density, as well as correlations arising from the coagulation term. Such non-linear effects have not been sufficiently studied. A method that has the potential for taking them into account is the PBE-PDF method, which is being developed within our research group. The objective of this project is to study the effect of fluctuations in soot. The study will be done with a stochastic model, the partially-stirred reactor (PaSR).

This results in repeated insertions, causing patient discomfort, and can prevent early diagnosis of tumours. In particular, since biopsy needles have a small diameter-to-length ratio, they are prone to buckling, which can occur suddenly at high insertion forces (e.g. in dense tissue such as liver). While the risk of buckling can be mitigated by employing stiffer needles with a larger diameter, this approach is not desirable for biopsies due to increased patient discomfort.

Building upon on our recent research, this project aims to investigate advanced control strategies and design solutions for active buckling avoidance in biopsy needles. The ultimate aim consists in improving biopsy accuracy and safety while reducing patient discomfort. 

As a minimum, the student will be expected to produce a fully functional mechatronic test rig for needle insertions in silicone phantoms, including actuators, position sensors, and force sensors. Additionally, the student will have the opportunity to combine design solutions with advanced control algorithms and to validate them experimentally.

It is anticipated that this work will result in publishable material (one international conference as a minimum) where the student could participate as co-author.

They can significantly reduce the vibration amplitudes and shift the resonance frequencies away from critical operating speeds, by exploiting the frictional energy dissipation at the contact interface. The Rolls-Royce Vibration UTC at IC  has been developing a reliable modelling approach to obtain accurate estimations of the dynamic response of turbines, facilitating the design of the underplatform dampers. However, the parameters defined in the model always involve large uncertainties due to the complexities of the physical phenomena occurring at the contact interface. For this reason, a deterministic modelling approach might lead to large errors in the prediction of the model. The objective of this project is to move away from this deterministic approach by including  the effects of uncertainties in the damper model, allowing the evaluation of their impact on the dynamic response of the turbine. Monte Carlo simulations will be used as  benchmark to obtain the statistics of the dynamic response. Two other key surrogate modelling techniques, namely Gaussian process and polynomial chaos expansion, will also be considered to reduce the computational cost.

This becomes a particular problem if the person would like to transport something that must not spilled such as a cup of coffee or a plate of food around their house. This project is working towards a mobile robot for home use that is able to transport objects between rooms for the disabled user. Previously a Stewart Platform was developed that is capable of stabilising a known object under random movement.

The aim of this project  is to further develop the platform to work with an unknown object. If time allows, the platform can be mounted onto a mobile base for home use so that it would be able to transport objects around different floor surfaces; however, this is not the focus of the project..

The mobile base shall be able to navigate along a series of predefined, virtual pathways; these pathways are assumed to be clear of obstacles but the robot should stop in the event of an obstruction. The robot shall be designed in such a way that anything carried will be stabilised to avoid spilling and is unaffected by any possible unevenness in the floor. This unevenness could be as a result of the transition between a smooth to a carpeted floor for example.

Objectives:
1. Further develop the Stewart platform to keep an unknown fluid payload level so that it is not affected by uneven floor. 
2. Integrate the platform into a simple mobile base that can follow predefined virtual passageways around a floor.
3. Give the mobile base the ability to detect obstacles and stop as a result of these obstructions.

In many engineering applications materials are chosen such that the strength and toughness are as high as possible. However, application in conservation can be considered to be more challenging, as the strength and toughness must be controlled to be less than that of the materials used to construct the object, but still high enough to prevent failure.

Student Research Project

Wearable technology is transforming sports training.  Recent work at the Biomechatronics laboratory has successfully commercialised a set of smart boxing gloves and has completed pilot work on a tennis stroke tracking system as well as a Tae Kwon Do kick tracking system.  

We are looking for students interested in expanding on this work in 3 areas:
1) Real-time implementation and testing .  This will involve new analysis of mechanics of movement in sports, interfacing the system with mechatronic sensors, and signal analysis of inertial movements.  Programming in either C, C++, or Matlab will be critical, and some embedded systems work may be a part of the project based on the interest of the student.

2) Machine learning for human performance assessment: As of now, nearly 1000 users are using the smart boxing gloves, and plans for the tennis system involve instrumenting the ICL college team.  Mechanics data from human motion for large groups of users as well as smaller groups using the system to train and improve is an under explored field today.  We are looking for students interested in quantifying how human movement can be modelled and tracked over time, and how this analysis may be used to assess (and improve) neural learning of motion such as moving in sports.  In the longer term, this should serve as a foundation to transform medical rehabilitation as well.  

3) Force sensing in combat sports: The smart boxing system tracks punch speed and attempts to estimate power, but force sensing (either in a glove or heavy bag) is critical for longer term training.  This project would involve sensor design for embedding electronics in boxing gloves, pads, and bags to calculate the exact punching or kicking force applied when struck.  It will involve mechatonic sensor design and data analysis to track force of impact.

A sensor that could reliably and objectively measure movements in the womb will be highly valuable to a number of scientific and medical applications. For example, the sensor could be an indication of fetal health and could serve as an early warning system for fetal distress. Fetal movement is thought to be critical to normal skeletal development.

The proposed sensor would make it possible to test this hypothesis, by correlating fetal movements in a large cohort with the incidence of DDH after birth. The sensor will also provide highly novel data on how the actions and activities of the mother affect the movements of the baby. For example, the sensor would enable us to test whether activities of the mother such as running or swimming affect the way the baby moves.  

This project will extend pilot work (described at:

to move closer to a clinically ready system that could help expectant mothers.  A range of sensors are possible including: strain sensors, motion/vibration sensors, and physiological sensors identifying muscle activity.  The project will identify the types of modalities of interest, investigate sensors capable of tracking biomarkers, conduct feasibility experiments, then develop a candidate sensing suite (based on pilot work by our team) that may be easily worn.  The wearable sensor will initially be tested on non pregnant subjects in order to test the basic function and wearability of the sensor. By the end of the project, movement â€˜signaturesâ€™ for common activities or functions that affect the lower abdomen should have been established, such as, for example, breathing, coughing, hiccups etc, so that these normal functions will be distinguishable from fetal movement signals.  It is hoped that a pregnant test subject can be recruited in the final stages of the project to test the sensorâ€™s success at measuring fetal movements.

Student Research Project

Wearable technology is transforming sports training.  Recent work at the Biomechatronics laboratory has successfully commercialised a set of smart boxing gloves and has completed pilot work on a tennis stroke tracking system as well as a Tae Kwon Do kick tracking system.  

We are looking for students interested in expanding on this work in 3 areas:
1) Real-time implementation and testing .  This will involve new analysis of mechanics of movement in sports, interfacing the system with mechatronic sensors, and signal analysis of inertial movements.  Programming in either C, C++, or Matlab will be critical, and some embedded systems work may be a part of the project based on the interest of the student.

2) Machine learning for human performance assessment: As of now, nearly 1000 users are using the smart boxing gloves, and plans for the tennis system involve instrumenting the ICL college team.  Mechanics data from human motion for large groups of users as well as smaller groups using the system to train and improve is an under explored field today.  We are looking for students interested in quantifying how human movement can be modelled and tracked over time, and how this analysis may be used to assess (and improve) neural learning of motion such as moving in sports.  In the longer term, this should serve as a foundation to transform medical rehabilitation as well.  

3) Force sensing in combat sports: The smart boxing system tracks punch speed and attempts to estimate power, but force sensing (either in a glove or heavy bag) is critical for longer term training.  This project would involve sensor design for embedding electronics in boxing gloves, pads, and bags to calculate the exact punching or kicking force applied when struck.  It will involve mechatonic sensor design and data analysis to track force of impact.

This scope of this system to track neural learning of players as they improve represents an exciting opportunity to explore human performance, mechatronics, and programming in an entirely new manner.  Possible directions include making the system work in real time on a smart watch, programming an app for the watch, testing on a range of tennis players, and analysing the data to understand how neural learning of motion can be mapped by wearable sensors.

The insertion of these implants requires repeated impaction with a hammer, and in some patients, the high forces generated causes their femur or acetabulum to fracture leading to v. poor outcomes.  It would be highly beneficial to identify patients with weak bone before attempting to impact the implant to reduce the risk of inadvertent fractures.  This project will test whether a novel yet simple intraoperative measurement technique can be correlated with more precisely measured femoral and acetabular bone properties.

156,21-09-18 14:04,21-09-18 14:04,50,Topology optimised hip implant,"Bone is a living tissue that adapts in response to mechanical loading.  Following total hip replacement, the stiff metallic femoral stem implant disrupts the natural load distribution in the femur, resulting in reduced mechanical stimulus to bone.  Overtime, this â€˜stress shieldingâ€™ results in bone loss, implant loosening and the need for complex revision surgery which typically has poor outcomes for patients.  Reducing the stiffness of the femoral stem would reduce the amount of stress shielding, and thus could help prevent this failure mechanism.

Topology optimisation is a finite element analysis based design tool that optimises the material distribution in a part for given loading or boundary (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAGFkWkqocI). This project will use topology optimisation to design a femoral stem that minimises stress shielding following hip replacement, whilst ensuring the implant has sufficient fatigue strength for the harsh loading environment of the hip joint.  The optimised stem will then be additively manufactured and tested in the lab as a proof of concept demonstration.

This project will be run in collaboration with a PhD student - Umar Hossain.

However, currently we are not able to predict the intensity and frequency of earthquakes accurately. We therefore use seismic models with a high degree of uncertainty.
In probabilistic safety assessment we want to model the risk of highly improbable accidents resulting in core melt. Experience shows us that earthquakes increase the risk that an accident will cause core melt. However, due to the high uncertainty in seismic models, the risk models that include seismic factors have a high degree of uncertainty.
An Imperial, a PhD student, supervised by research fellow Keith Ardron, has created a risk model that accounts for the uncertainty in the seismic events and obtains an estimate of core melt frequency. The model is available in Python.
CRA also owns the licence for a commercial software (HazardLite) that calculates an estimate of core melt frequency + uncertainty. However the software has not been tested nor benchmarked for use in the UK.
During the project the student is expected to recreate the existing PhD test case in HazardLite and compare the results obtained by Python with those obtained in Hazard Lite. Then other more complex test cases will be developed and run during the course of the project. The results obtained by HazardLite and Imperial risk model will be compared.
The objective is to build a library of test cases for both the commercial software and the Imperial risk model. In addition this work will lead to an increased understanding of the modelling behind the commercial software.
The project will have a strong nuclear industry involvement. The associate supervisor within the Department, Keith Ardron, was until recently licensing manager in the United Kingdom for Areva. The project will be run in collaboration with Corporate Risk Associates (http://crarisk.com), the United Kingdom's largest nuclear risk analysis consultancy, and much of the work would be undertaken at their premises in London.

158,02-10-18 11:00,02-10-18 11:00,51,Sensitivity studies for modelling the consequences of radioactive releases for an Advanced Modular Reactor.,"Imperial College and Corporate Risk Associates are continuing an exploration of the possible consequences of radiological releases from Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).  SMRs are  characterized by being small in size (less than 300 MWe) and for being modular to permit rapid construction.  The work performed by Imperial College to date has been shared with SMR vendors and international agencies such as the IAEA and OECD.  Following the current global and British interest in SMRs, the proposed study will involve the analysis of Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs).  AMRs are a subset of SMRs characterized by not being cooled by water but for other innovative coolants.
Several coolants are being proposed for AMRs: molten salts, sodium and lead, among others.  These types of coolants have the potential to operate at atmospheric pressure, leading to lower pressures within the reactor in case of an accident.  Another major claimed benefit is the theory that following an accident, most of the fission products are believed to be retained in the coolant.  It is possible that the only harmful products that may escape are the noble gases, Krypton and Xenon (due to their minimal chemical reactivity, and small solubility in the coolant).
As a result the source term released in a postulated accident may be  much less severe than for other reactor types, and due to the lower primary circuit pressures, the height of the release is estimated to be smaller and the duration of the release is estimated to be longer.  These parameters are likely to have an impact on the potential harm that arises from a release.
This project involves studying the dispersion and resulting harm of the released radionuclides from AMRs using a Level 3 Probabilistic Safety Analysis (PSA) software code produced by Public Health England. The project will investigate how parameters such as release height and duration, source term radionuclide make-up and geographic siting of the AMR affect harm (to people and the environment) following a radiological release. 
The project will have a strong nuclear industry involvement. The associate supervisor within the Department, Keith Ardron, was until recently licensing manager in the United Kingdom for Areva.

This functional module has enabled a large number of experimentally verified FE simulation results to be established. For a metal forming FE simulation, the thermo-mechanical characteristics of each FE element at all moments in time are stored enabling the study and optimisation of forming processes in a detailed way. One of the aims of the big-data module system is to develop testing guidelines in an efficient way by using a data-driven guideline to specify appropriate test conditions, thus ensuring experimental tests are carried out that capture all appropriate data for FE simulations. Successful application of this data-driven guideline would reduce the number of tests performed leading to the development of more accurate material models at lower cost, which in turn enhance the accuracy and speed of developing FE simulations.

The aim of this project is to develop and improve the existing big-data database for metal forming processes, with basic Matlab skills being a requirement. In this research project, the following work will be conducted:
-	To analyse the hot stamping of aluminium alloy through the existing big-data system.
-	To improve the big-data analysis technique and develop new methods, including distribution, evolution, association and clustering etc.

Expected output:
-	A comparison of thermo-mechanical characteristics of Al alloy sheet blank formed at different conditions.
-	A comparison of thermo-mechanical characteristics of different materials formed at different forming techniques.
-	Scientific publications

These carriers are hollow structures and are commonly lipid vesicles and polymersomes. Depending on the structure of the cargo carrier, multiple cargo of different chemistries can be transported within one carrier.

The encapsulated chemical must be released when they reach their destinations. There are various triggers for such release, one of which is through applied shear.  In this study, you would use dissipative particle dynamic simulation to simulate how polymersomes (our model nano-cargo carriers) release their cargo . Specifically we are interested in how the structure of the polymersome and its interactions with the environment affect the mechanisms of cargo release.

Although prior knowledge is not required, students must be eager to explore the physics and chemistry of the phenomena involved. You should be curious and interested in understanding fundamentally how molecules interact with surfaces.  You should have strong programming skills.  Some background in chemistry (chemical engineering) will be very helpful.  In return you get support from your supervisors and the research group, which include weekly personal and group meetings, regular presentation practice and learning exciting experimental techniques (should you choose to run some experiments).",1,1,1,0,1,0

However, epoxies are typically quite brittle materials which can lead to premature failure in service. Consequently, various means of toughening these materials are used to mitigate this. Means of toughening epoxies can be considered intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic toughening of epoxies involves changing the rigidity of the precursor molecules used and the crosslink density within the epoxyâ€™s network. Extrinsic toughening often involves the introduction of particles, typically on the order of size of tens of nanometres up to microns, within the epoxy that promote plastic deformation. Extrinsic toughening particles can also be low surface energy materials (e.g. polysiloxane core-shell rubber particles). However, the effectiveness of intrinsic vs extrinsic toughening of epoxies and their nanocomposites on their surface energies and wear behaviour is not well understood and warrants further investigation. By systematically varying the composition and, so, properties of these materials, means of simultaneously optimising epoxies for toughness and wear resistance will be identified.

This project will be performed in co-operation with an industrial partner company based in London and run by Imperial graduates. 

Aim:
To assess the tribological behaviour (friction and wear) of a selection of epoxy polymers and their nanocomposites prepared by systematically varying their mechanical properties and surface energies. 

Research tasks:
- Make coupons of epoxies that are systematically toughened to varying degrees, but where the means of toughening varies from intrinsic toughening to extrinsic toughening with low and high surface energy particles; (this will be done with the help of an external industrial partner company run by ex Imperial graduates)
- Characterise the mechanical properties of these samples through standard tests: tension, plane strain compression, SENB testing; measure surface energies of materials; contact angle goniometer
- Characterise the tribological properties of these materials using existing experimental set-ups in the Tribology Group at Imperial
- Relate the effect of varying mechanical properties and surface energy on tribological behaviour.
