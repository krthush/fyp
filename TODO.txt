TODO:

Get the search working using better routes/input (there is a bug now with select project due to this)

AJAX the select , rank up, rank down, deselect project (there is a bug now with select project due to this)

At the end remove ability for staff to select projects - redundant and makes it confusing

Include indicators for the ranks - not very clear that the order represents order right now

From earlier:
 
	search, filtering (at least by experimental, computational, etc.), tags

	layout stuff

	additional columns for projects/user objects

	allow staff to select students

	Fix bug with author ordering

	There maybe an easier way to display the individual user's like order on the project page rather than a double forloop -> look into this
