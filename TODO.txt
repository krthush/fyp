HIGH TODOs:

	Create overview table for staff to see all students liking projects and their order (instead of having to go individual projects)

	At the end remove ability for staff to select projects - redundant and makes it confusing

	Make super uber admin portal for ambrose so he can roll out student selection, staff selection for specific student ranks (e.g. only let them select rank 1 students) and so on... IMPORTANT: from this he should also be able to export tables

LOW TODOs:

	Need to fix pagination, its a bit messed up atm -> doesn't really work with "ordering"

	AJAX the select , rank up, rank down, deselect project

From earlier TODOs:
 
	search, filtering (at least by experimental, computational, etc.), tags

	layout stuff

	additional columns for projects/user objects

	allow staff to select students

	Fix bug with author ordering

	There maybe an easier way to display the individual user's like order on the project page rather than a double forloop -> look into this

DONE:
	
	For selected projects, make them into modals similar to the searched projects rather than leading to a different page, less UX friendly

	Include indicators for the ranks - not very clear that the order represents order right now

	Remember UG = ME4

	Get the search working using better routes/input (there is a bug now with select project due to this)
