HIGH TODOs:

	At the end remove ability for staff to select projects - redundant and makes it confusing

	Make super uber admin portal for ambrose so he can roll out student selection, staff selection for specific student ranks (e.g. only let them select rank 1 students) and so on... IMPORTANT: from this he should also be able to export tables

LOW TODOs:

	Add user choosen pagination size (like show 25, 50, 100, etc.)

	AJAX the select , rank up, rank down, deselect project

	Need to fix pagination, only a small bug where on some pages when using "orberby" the ranking isn't correct

	Time to submission/deadline somewhere

	Submit projects button? To email or something? Limit number of submissions?

	Sliders for % experimental, computational, etc. I.E. overall breakdown of projects

From earlier TODOs:
 
	Search, filtering (at least by experimental, computational, etc.), tags

	Layout stuff

	Additional columns for projects/user objects

	Allow staff to select students

	Fix bug with author ordering

	There maybe an easier way to display the individual user's like order on the project page rather than a double forloop -> look into this

DONE:


	Show total number of searched projects/total number of projects

	Create overview table for staff to see all students liking projects and their order (instead of having to go individual projects)
	
	For selected projects, make them into modals similar to the searched projects rather than leading to a different page, less UX friendly

	Include indicators for the ranks - not very clear that the order represents order right now

	Remember UG = ME4

	Get the search working using better routes/input (there is a bug now with select project due to this)

Future Stuff:

	Tagging/keyword system to improve search

	Filters -> specific searching
	
	Images

	Suggested projects for students based on similarities
